## Project Specifications

- The index.html file will need to declare all the divs, as well as a title and button. 
- The script.js file will contain all the code for the game. It should include a function to initialize the game board(called when start button is pushed). Another function is needed to toggle the lights of a single square and its neighbors (called when a square is clicked). Lastly a function is needed to count the number of squares with lights off, if all lights are off a win message should appear.
- The style.css file will need to declare the classes "light" and "dark" for our functions to toggle the squares between. The content of the page must be centered and other stylistic choices should also go in this file if desired.
